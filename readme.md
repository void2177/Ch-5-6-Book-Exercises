Almost all the solutions that were functioning were
pretty much identical to the instructor's
solution. The ones that didn't function 
differed from the instructor's solution.
Largely, these were the ones based off
the JupyTurtle module, which I have
difficulties with sometimes. However, 
everything is attributable to what's written
above.
